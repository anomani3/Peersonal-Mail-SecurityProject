This project deals with the Mailing System. This project is having different modules like
new User creation form named it as a Sign-Up form and already existing user can logged into the
Mailing System named it as a Sign In form.
Totally furnished with the security with personal use ,there is a fear of message tempered
by the hacker in the time of sending of the message the way or medium of message sending
hacker can hack it so in my system we have to encrypt the message first after that sending the
message ,hacker can hack the message but this is not a readable form, so this is very useful for
personal level security, Here in this message won‟t be tempered between sender and receiver.
This program provide you privacy as well as high level of security.
Advantages:
.
E-Mails are most frequently used in today‟s commerce. Now-a-days these are the most
convenient way of communication
for ordinary users. E-Mails are public and can be seen by everyone at every point of
communication between two users. Hence, because of their exposed nature we can‟t write
sensitive information in ordinary e-mails.
So we can encrypt the message first then send through our personal mail security website .
In which hacker can not be able to decrypt the message so this is highly secured with the help of
this user cam send the message confidentially and user have no doubt for hacking or tempering
the message so this is very benificial for sending secured message
